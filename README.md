# üéÆ Sprint 6 Project ‚Äî Ice Video Game Sales Analysis (Integrated Project)

---

üß† **Project Overview**  
In this sprint, I worked as a data analyst for **Ice**, an international online video game store.  
The company provided historical data on **game sales, genres, platforms, critic and user reviews**, and **ESRB ratings**.  
My mission was to identify patterns that determine whether a game is likely to succeed ‚Äî helping the marketing team detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns effectively.

For this project, I used open-source data up to **2016**, simulating that I was preparing a marketing plan for **2017**.  
The goal was to apply all the statistical and analytical skills developed throughout the previous sprints in one integrated, end-to-end case study.

## üéØ Project Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.  
- Analyze sales by platform, genre, and region.  
- Explore the impact of critic and user ratings on sales performance.  
- Identify trends in platform lifecycles (growth and decline).  
- Profile user preferences across North America, Europe, and Japan.  
- Test hypotheses on user rating differences between platforms and genres.  
- Draw business insights to guide 2017 marketing strategy.

## üß© Project Steps  

### Step 1 ‚Äì Data Loading & Inspection  
- Imported `games.csv` and reviewed its structure.  
- Checked data types, missing values, and overall consistency.  
- Noted that **TBD** entries represent ‚Äúto be determined‚Äù values and required special handling.  

### Step 2 ‚Äì Data Preparation  
- Converted column names to lowercase.  
- Adjusted data types (e.g., `year_of_release` ‚Üí `int`, scores ‚Üí `float`).  
- Replaced or imputed missing values as appropriate and documented reasons.  
- Added a `total_sales` column = `na_sales + eu_sales + jp_sales + other_sales`.  
- Verified data accuracy after transformations.  

### Step 3 ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Analyzed game release trends by year to determine data relevance.  
- Compared total sales across platforms and identified top-performing ones.  
- Examined lifecycle patterns ‚Äî when platforms rise and decline in popularity.  
- Focused analysis on **recent and relevant years** to predict 2017 trends.  
- Created boxplots of global sales per platform to identify outliers and variability.  
- Studied correlations between **critic/user reviews** and **sales** on top platforms.  
- Compared performance of the same titles across multiple platforms.  
- Assessed the profitability of different genres.  

### Step 4 ‚Äì Regional User Profiling  
For each region (**NA**, **EU**, **JP**):  
- Identified the **top 5 platforms** and **top 5 genres**.  
- Compared market shares and consumer preferences across regions.  
- Evaluated whether **ESRB ratings** influence sales differently per region.  

### Step 5 ‚Äì Hypothesis Testing  
**Hypothesis 1:**  
- **H‚ÇÄ:** Average user ratings for Xbox One and PC games are equal.  
- **H‚ÇÅ:** Average user ratings differ between Xbox One and PC games.  

**Hypothesis 2:**  
- **H‚ÇÄ:** Average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are equal.  
- **H‚ÇÅ:** Average user ratings differ between Action and Sports genres.  

- Set significance level **Œ± = 0.05**.  
- Applied **independent two-sample t-tests** (`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`).  
- Interpreted p-values and drew conclusions on statistical significance.  

### Step 6 ‚Äì Conclusion  
- Summarized which **platforms and genres** are most profitable.  
- Highlighted how **critic and user scores** impact sales.  
- Provided insights for **marketing and inventory planning** for 2017.

## üí° Key Analytical Questions  
- Which gaming platforms are gaining or losing popularity?  
- What genres deliver the highest total sales?  
- How do critic and user ratings influence success?  
- Do sales patterns differ significantly between regions?  
- How should Ice allocate advertising efforts based on 2016 data?
